        The boosted tree algorithm performed the best. The test error for all LDA <em>k</em> categories was the lowest.
        All predictors from the kNN model were used. The model can be improved by using a grid k-fold cross validation
        to determine the optimal shrinkage parameters and number of trees to aggregate.
        <br>
        At base this model performs well emough, and it will be used to sift through new data!
