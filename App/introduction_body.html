    stack<b>overflow</b> is a question and answer <a href=https://stackoverflow.com>site</a> for programmers, started
    by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky in 2008. The site functions as a forum for users to ask and answer questions. Posted
    answers and questions can be voted up or down by other uses as well. It serves as an incredible resource for amatuer
    and professional programmers. Being able to tap into that resource requires a question be posed with sufficient
    details and accurate nomenclature, or the exact details lacking by the befuddled programmer. This
    often can be remedied by normal in-person dialouge, however in an online forum, the dialouge is absent. Asking a
    question incorrectly, can make it difficult for a solution to reach the user in distress. The work required by the
    user to figure <em>how</em> to ask their question often leads to them figuring out their own answer or realizing
    that
    someone else has already asked the same question.

    In this applet, I explore what topics and through-lines comprise answers posted to stackoverflow with Non-parametric
    Bayesian techniques. Using the subsequent findings, I applied common supervised learning techniques to model where
    new questions fall. Lastly, one can submit their own questions, preferably questions already on stackoverflow, to
    find out what broader topic they might be asking about.

    The end product is an applet that further helps R padawans understand what contexts their problem is situated in. As
    you explore this dashboard you will learn about latent dirichlet allocation, k-Nearest Neighbors, Discriminant
    analysis, Naive Bayes classification, logistic regression, the top scoring questions on stackoverflow, and
    presumably the biggest pain points for R users. Enjoy!
