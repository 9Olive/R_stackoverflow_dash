        Use the 'Plot Paramters' drop down menu to toggle different views of the plot to the right. In general, you can
        view comparisons of the 'Score', or number of upvotes, a question or answer has recieved since it has been
        posted.

        It's pretty clear that there appears to be some correlation between the distribution of Score and when the
        question or answer was posted. Broadly speaking, the popularity of R as a programming language can be gleaned as
        well. Some notable results are:
        <ul>
            <li>The trend of inquiries and replies over time has been increasing.</li>
            <li>Mean score tends to decrease as the number of submissions increase.</li>
        </ul>
        The value in these trends would be if it has discriminating power between question topics. Of course, I'll have
        to figure out those topics first. I use Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and that can be viewed in the next tab.
