        There is an additional dataset that came with the questions and answers dataset. The tags that the user
        specified upon posting their question. Essentially, I take this dataset and see if any of the tags are in a list
        of top R functions and their respective packages. The list of functions and packages come from the work done by
        Vlad Kozhevnikov can be read about <a
            href=https://towardsdatascience.com/top-100-most-used-r-functions-on-github-9caf2b81b314>here</a>. On that
        article was a link to the code used to parse and collect such data, and the resulting dataset.
        <br>
        The number of matches tags, matched top functions, and matched top pacakges are recorded as parameters of a
        question.
